## 📌 Project Overview

**NeuroCoderFL** is an ongoing development project aimed at building a **Federated, Privacy-Preserving, Self-Improving Compiler** architecture powered by **Large Language Model (LLM)-driven feedback optimization**. The project integrates principles from federated learning, compiler theory, natural language feedback, and reinforcement learning to enable distributed systems to collaboratively improve code generation and optimization without compromising local data privacy.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This repository is currently in the **building phase**. Code is actively being developed, tested, and refined. Some modules and functionalities are yet to be implemented or stabilized.

## ✨ Key Features (Planned)

- **Federated Learning-Based Compiler Optimization**  
  Enable distributed compiler agents to collaboratively learn optimal code transformations from decentralized data.

- **LLM-Driven Feedback Loop**  
  Integrate natural language feedback using LLMs (e.g., GPT) to continuously refine compiler strategies.

- **Differential Privacy and Secure Aggregation**  
  Preserve user privacy using DP mechanisms and encrypted model updates.

- **Cross-Device Adaptability**  
  Design tailored for edge and heterogeneous device environments.

- **Modular and Extensible Design**  
  Future-proof architecture to plug in various LLMs, optimization rules, and target languages.
