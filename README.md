## 1. Problem Statement

**Title:** NeuroCoderFL: A Federated, Self-Improving Compiler with LLM-Driven Feedback & Optimization

**Background & Motivation:**  
Modern software development demands tools that not only compile code but also optimize, debug, and educate. Developers often struggle with performance bottlenecks, style inconsistencies, and security vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, educational settings require privacy-preserving code evaluation at scale. Integrating Federated Learning (FL) with compiler technologies and large language models (LLMs) can bridge these gaps by continuously improving feedback from decentralized user data without compromising privacy.

**Core Problem:**  
1. **Privacy vs. Improvement:** How can we collect meaningful insights from multiple users’ code to train and update ML models without centralizing source code and risking privacy?  
2. **Adaptive Feedback:** How can we generate personalized, context-aware feedback (style, performance, bug fixes) in real time, powered by LLMs and optimized ML modules?  
3. **Optimization Intelligence:** How can we use reinforcement learning to suggest code transformations that meaningfully improve performance across diverse codebases?

**Objectives:**  
- Design a federated learning pipeline that aggregates model updates (not raw code) from edge clients.  
- Integrate LLM-based feedback generation to offer explanations, optimizations, and learning pointers.  
- Develop an RL-based optimization agent to propose performance-enhancing code transformations.  
- Deploy as a web application for easy access, demonstration, and integration into educational platforms or developer IDEs.
